            <h2 class="title-black">Welcome to Transition To Success and Map of My Dreams</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Transition To Success® (TTS). This TTS Workbook and Guide is designed specifically for YOU.
              Together with your Transition To Success (TTS) Coach, you will map your journey to your dreams and work
              together to make those dreams come true. Just like taking a trip, know where you are going to make sure
              you get there. Go after what you want. Make your dreams become reality. Mapping Dreams is for everyone,
              regardless of your age, race, religion, male or female, rich or poor. All of us have dreams.</p>
            <h3 class="title-pink">“How do I make my dreams come true?</h3>
            <p>Just ask anyone, "What's your dream?". You will find there are as many dreams as there are people. Having
              dreams is the easy part. Making your dreams come true is the tough part and requires so much more than
              just wishing. Making dreams come true requires hope, plans, the ability to ask for help, determination,
              and money. Making a real plan, designed by you, that will work for you, is the path to your success. </p>
            <p>Each step you take brings you one step closer to your dream. Each step is a reason to celebrate. And,
              when "life happens" and a step suddenly turns into a slip or a fall, YOU start again. Just like a wrong
              turn on a map, the key is to reroute. DO NOT STOP. Do not turn around. Keep moving. Everyone has missteps,
              even when moving in the right direction. What really matters is what you do next.</p>

                  Did you know –
                </h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Michael Jordan did not make the cut for his high school basketball team.</li>
                  <li>Thomas Edison had over 1000 failed attempts at a light bulb. </li>
                  <li>Oprah was told she didn’t have a “face” for television. </li>
                  <li>Dr. Seuss’ 1st book was rejected 27 times before it was finally published.</li>
                </ul>
              </article>
  
              <p>From now on giving up is not an option. To be the best you, you must embrace the missteps, learn from your
                mistakes, and re-route. Keep moving, and YOU will get to your destinations.</p>
